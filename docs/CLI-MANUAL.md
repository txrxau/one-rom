# One ROM CLI Manual

`onerom` (`onerom.exe` on Windows) is the command-line tool for managing One ROM
ROM emulators: discovering connected devices, building and flashing firmware,
inspecting device state, and manipulating ROM image files.

This manual is in two parts. The **Guide** walks through installation and the
common workflows. The **Reference** documents every command, subcommand and
option.

> This manual documents the `onerom` CLI as of release v0.3.0. Board,
> chip and plugin lists shown in examples are illustrative — the set your build
> supports may differ. Run `onerom --version` to check your version, and
> `onerom board list` / `onerom chips` for the definitive lists your build knows
> about. Commands marked **(not yet supported)** are present in the CLI surface
> but not yet functional.

# Part 1 — Guide

## Installation

Download the CLI from **<https://onerom.org/cli>**. Builds are provided for:

- Windows — x86 64-bit and ARM 64-bit
- macOS
- Ubuntu/Debian — x86 64-bit, and ARM 64-bit (also for Raspberry Pi)

The Windows and macOS builds are digitally signed. A sha256 checksum is published
alongside every download so you can verify what you fetched.

**Windows / macOS** — unzip the archive and place the `onerom` (`onerom.exe`)
executable in a folder on your `PATH`.

**Linux** — install the `.deb` as usual, which places `onerom` on your `PATH`:

```
sudo dpkg -i onerom-cli-x.y.z-1_amd64.deb
```

(replace `x.y.z` with the version, e.g. `0.1.10`, and `amd64` with `arm64` for
the ARM/Pi build).

**Windows SmartScreen** — as a relatively new publisher, the first run may raise
a *"Windows protected your PC"* dialog. Click **More info**, confirm the
publisher reads *"Open Source Developer, Piers Finlayson"*, then **Run anyway**.

Verify it runs:

```
onerom --version
```

## How One ROM talks to the CLI

The CLI communicates with a One ROM over USB using picoboot (the Raspberry Pi
bootloader protocol, extended by
[picobootx](https://github.com/piersfinlayson/picobootx)). A One ROM is reachable in two
situations:

- **Running** — normal firmware is running and serving ROMs; its USB stack
  (provided by the system USB plugin) exposes the picobootx interface.
- **Stopped** — the device is in the RP2350 bootloader (BOOTSEL). A bare RP2350
  bootloader is also reachable here, which is how unprogrammed or bricked units
  are recovered.

Some commands work in either state; some require one specifically. Each
reference entry notes when a device connection is required, and the state model
is summarised under [Device states](#device-states).

## Identifying your device

With **exactly one** One ROM connected that the CLI recognises, you don't need
to identify it — commands find it automatically, and the board type is inferred
from the device.

With **multiple** devices connected, select one with `--serial` (`-s`). It
accepts `*` and `?` wildcards:

```
onerom --serial 'A1B2*' inspect info
```

`--serial` is **global**: it can appear at any level of the command line.

A device programmed with a serial override (`program --serial-override`) reports
and is matched by that overridden serial while **Running**. When **Stopped** its
USB stack comes from the RP2350 bootrom, so it falls back to reporting its chip
ID — match it by chip ID (or reboot it to running) in that state.

Discover what's attached:

```
onerom scan
onerom scan --slots        # also list each device's ROM slots
```

Two situations need extra flags:

- **Unrecognised / unprogrammed / bricked** units: add `--unrecognised` (`-u`)
  and supply `--board`, since the board type can't be inferred. The unit must
  still expose a valid picoboot USB interface.
- **Non-standard USB IDs**: add `--vid-pid <VID:PID>` (hex), repeatable. When
  supplied, only the given VID/PID pairs are matched.

`--board` (`-b`) can also be given on most commands to **override** the detected
board type.

## Common workflows

### Program a device from a config file

The primary workflow. Build firmware from a JSON config and flash it in one
step:

```
onerom program --config c64.json
```

`program` builds *and* flashes. To build a firmware binary **without** flashing,
use [`firmware build`](#firmware-build) instead. To build and also keep the
binary while flashing, add `--output`:

```
onerom program --config c64.json --out firmware.bin
```

### Program from `--slot` specifications

Instead of a config file, describe each ROM slot inline. Repeat `--slot` per
slot. The required chip-select lines depend on the chip type (e.g. a 2332 needs
`cs1` and `cs2`):

```
onerom program --board fire-24-e \
    --slot file=kernal.bin,type=2364,cs1=active-low \
    --slot file=basic.bin,type=2364,cs1=active-low
```

The full slot spec grammar is documented under [ROM slot
specification](#rom-slot-specification) — it covers CS polarity, size handling,
per-slot CPU frequency/voltage, the status LED and 16-bit forcing.

### Program with a plugin

Plugins masquerade as ROMs. At most one system plugin and one user plugin are
supported; a user plugin requires a system plugin. The system plugin lands in
slot 0, the user plugin in slot 1:

```
onerom program --board fire-24-e \
    --slot file=kernal.bin,type=2364,cs1=active-low \
    --plugin usb
```

`--plugin` may also be combined with `--config`. The plugins are inserted
ahead of the config's ROM slots (which shift up accordingly), so you can add a
plugin to a stock config without editing it:

```
onerom program --config c64.json --plugin usb
```

It is an error if the config already defines a plugin of its own — remove it
from the config, or drop `--plugin`.

Plugin spec forms are listed under [Plugin
specification](#plugin-specification).

### Build firmware without flashing

```
onerom firmware build --config c64.json --board fire-24-e --out firmware.bin
```

### Inspect a device

```
onerom inspect info      # serial, name, board, MCU, firmware version, hw revision
onerom inspect slots     # ROM slots, with the active one marked
```

### Read the live ROM image

Read what the device would serve for a given logical ROM address (device must be
running). The top-level `peek` is an alias for `inspect peek live`:

```
onerom peek live --address 0x100 --length 64
onerom peek live --address 0 --length 8192 --output rom-image.bin
```

### Patch a running image

`poke live` writes to the ROM image currently being served, at a logical ROM
offset. Changes are transient — lost on reboot. The top-level `poke` is an alias
for `control poke live`:

```
onerom poke live --address 0x100 --byte 0xEA
onerom poke live --address 0 --input patch.bin
```

For file patches you can write only the differing bytes, and preview first:

```
onerom poke live --input patch.bin --delta --dry-run
onerom poke live --input patch.bin --delta
```

### Identify a physical unit

Make the status LED beacon so you can spot which board is which:

```
onerom control led beacon
```

### Reset the host system after programming

If you have run a wire from a One ROM header pad to the reset line of the
machine One ROM is installed in, `control reset` pulses that pad low and then
releases it — resetting the host so it picks up the image you just flashed.
Name the pad, or the MCU GPIO behind it — `onerom inspect header` shows which
that is:

```
onerom program --config c64.json
onerom control reset --pin sel_c
```

The pad is typically an image-select pad whose jumper you have removed, usually
`sel_c`, or an `X1`/`X2` pad. The device times the pulse, so an interrupted CLI
cannot leave the host held in reset. See [`control reset`](#control-reset), and
[`control pin`](#control-pin) for driving a GPIO to an arbitrary state.

### See what One ROM is doing with its GPIOs

```
onerom inspect gpio
```

One row per MCU GPIO: everything that GPIO is — its ROM socket signal under the
image being served, the board peripheral it drives, the header pad it surfaces
on — plus direction, level, 5V tolerance, and what One ROM itself is using it
for. GPIOs connected to nothing are omitted unless you pass `--all`. Useful
before driving a pin — see [`inspect gpio`](#inspect-gpio).

### Erase / recover a device

Erase flash. This is best done while stopped; by default the command reboots the
device into the required state first. A fully erased unit falls back to the
RP2350 bootloader and is then reprogrammed with `--unrecognised` + `--board`:

```
onerom control erase --all
onerom control erase --offset 0x20000 --length 0x1000
```

Read [`control erase`](#control-erase) before using it while the device is
running — erasing the core firmware or system plugin will take down the USB
stack.

### Prepare a 16-bit ROM image

16-bit ROM types (e.g. 27C400) may need their byte pairs swapped to match the
order One ROM expects. Either rewrite the file first:

```
onerom image swap-bytes --input kick.bin --output kick-swapped.bin
```

or let the build do it, leaving the source file untouched:

```
onerom program --slot file=kick.bin,type=27C400,transform=swap_bytes
```

If your image interleaves several devices in one file — a 32-bit ROM set, say —
`deinterleave` extracts a single lane. See
[Image transforms](#image-transforms) for the full set and how they compose.

## Device states

Many commands reboot the device and, by default, pause briefly afterwards to let
it re-enumerate on the USB bus.

- **Running** (default reboot target) — firmware active, serving ROMs.
- **Stopped** — RP2350 bootloader (BOOTSEL); required for some flash operations.

Common controls, where a command supports them:

- `--running` (`-r`) / `--stopped` (`-p`) — choose the post-operation state.
- `--no-reboot` — leave the device as-is.
- `--fast` — skip the re-enumeration pause.
- `--msd` (`-m`) — mount the mass-storage device when rebooting into stopped
  mode.

## Global behaviour worth knowing

- `--yes` (`-y`) auto-confirms all prompts (non-interactive use). It also
  suppresses the confirmation otherwise required for CPU frequencies above
  150 MHz and voltages above 1.10 V in slot specs. Use with care.
- `--verbose` (`-v`) prints device-selection progress and other detail.
- `--log-level <LEVEL>` sets log verbosity; defaults to `warn`. Run
  `onerom --help` for the accepted levels.

# Part 2 — Reference

## Synopsis

```
onerom [GLOBAL OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [ARGS]
```

## Global options

Available on every command (they are `global` in clap terms and may appear at
any level).

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--serial, -s <DEVICE>` | Select a One ROM by serial number. Required when multiple are connected; auto-selected when exactly one is present. Accepts `*` and `?` wildcards. |
| `--vid-pid <VID:PID>` (alias `--id`) | USB vendor/product ID pair in hex (e.g. `1234:abcd`). Repeatable; when given, only these pairs are matched. Use with `--unrecognised`. |
| `--unrecognised, -u` (alias `--unrecognized`) | Allow management of unrecognised/unprogrammed/bricked RP2350 boards. The unit must still expose a valid picoboot USB interface. Use with caution — permits programming any attached RP2350 board. |
| `--yes, -y` | Auto-confirm all prompts. Also suppresses the over-limit CPU frequency/voltage confirmations. |
| `--verbose, -v` | Enable verbose output. |
| `--log-level <LEVEL>` | Set log level. Defaults to `warn`. |
| `--version, -V` | Print version. |
| `--help, -h` | Print help. Works on any subcommand. |

Most commands accept `--board` (`-b`) to identify or override the board type,
and rely on `--serial` (global) to pick a specific device.

Ice (STM32) boards are recognised, but the CLI cannot scan, program or build
firmware for them. Where `--board` reaches a device or builds an image, naming
an Ice board is an error rather than a later failure. Commands that only report
hardware take them; each command's own entry below states what it accepts, and
[`board list`](#board-list) shows which boards are which.

---

## scan

Discover and list connected One ROMs — serial, USB location, name, board type,
MCU and loaded firmware version. With `--verbose` (`-v`), each device also
shows its MCU variant and chip ID.

```
onerom scan
onerom scan --board fire-24-e
onerom scan --slots
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--board <BOARD>` | Only show devices matching this board type. Conflicts with `--list-boards`. Must be a Fire board — a scan cannot find an Ice board. |
| `--list-boards` | List the known board types, the same listing as [`board list`](#board-list). |
| `--slots` (alias `--slot`) | Also show the ROM slot contents for each device found. Conflicts with `--list-boards`. |

Device required: no.

---

## program

Build a firmware image (from a config file, inline `--slot` specs, or a supplied
binary) and flash it to a connected One ROM. This is the primary workflow.
`onerom firmware program` is an alias for this command.

```
onerom program --config c64.json
onerom program --serial '5*' --config c64.json
onerom program --board fire-24-e \
    --slot file=kernal.bin,type=2364,cs1=active-low \
    --slot file=basic.bin,type=2364,cs1=active-low
onerom program --firmware firmware.bin
onerom program --config c64.json --out firmware.bin
```

### Source of the firmware (mutually exclusive groups)

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--config, -j <FILE>` (aliases `--config-file`, `--config-json`, `--json`) | ROM configuration JSON file. Conflicts with `--slot`, `--config-name`, `--config-description`, `--save-config`, `--no-config`, `--firmware`. |
| `--slot <SPEC>` (alias `--rom`) | ROM slot specification; repeatable. See [ROM slot specification](#rom-slot-specification). Conflicts with `--config`, `--no-config`, `--firmware`. |
| `--firmware <FILE>` (alias `--fw`) | Flash a pre-built complete firmware binary directly. Conflicts with `--config`, `--slot`, `--base-firmware` and `--plugin` because a pre-built firmware already contains all ROMs/plugins. Also conflicts with `--version`. |
| `--base-firmware <FILE>` | Use a local minimal firmware instead of downloading. With `--slot`, ROMs are built into it; alone, requires `--no-config`. Must be built with `EXCLUDE_METADATA=1` and `ROM_CONFIGS=`. Conflicts with `--firmware`, `--version`. |
| `--no-config` | Confirm flashing a base firmware with no ROM configuration. Only valid with `--config-name` and/or `--config-description`. Conflicts with `--config`, `--slot`, `--firmware`, and the config-override options below. |

### Configuration metadata

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--plugin <SPEC>` | Plugin specification; repeatable. See [Plugin specification](#plugin-specification). May be combined with `--config`: the plugins are inserted ahead of the config's ROM slots (which shift up), and it is an error if the config already defines a plugin of its own. Conflicts with `--firmware`. |
| `--config-name <NAME>` (alias `--name`) | Name for the generated ROM configuration. Conflicts with `--config`. |
| `--config-description <DESC>` (aliases `--desc`, `--description`) | Description for the generated configuration. Defaults to *"Created by the One ROM CLI"*. Conflicts with `--config`. |
| `--save-config <FILE>` | Save the generated configuration to JSON. Only valid with `--slot` or `--no-config`. Conflicts with `--config`. |

### Per-device overrides

These are rejected with `--no-config`.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--instance-name <NAME>` (aliases `--onerom`, `--one-rom`, `--onerom-name`, `--one-rom-name`, …) | Give this One ROM a name. |
| `--serial-override <NEW SERIAL>` | Override the device's reported serial number. |
| `--logging [BOOL]` (aliases `--boot-logging`) | Enable boot logging. Takes an optional boolean; bare flag means `true`. |
| `--disable-swd [BOOL]` (aliases `--swd-disable`) | Shut SWD down before ROM serving starts, so debug port accesses to SRAM don't steal cycles from the serving DMAs. SWD is available for the whole of boot — including boot logging — and goes off until the next reset. Nothing is logged past that point, and plugins get no logging. This is not a debug lockout: the boot ROM runs before the One ROM firmware does, and BOOTSEL/PICOBOOT are unaffected. Optional boolean; bare flag means `true`. |
| `--turbo-boot [BOOL]` | Enable turbo boot — starts serving faster by not reading the image select jumpers, so the first non-plugin slot is always the one served. More than one non-plugin slot is refused unless `--force` is given. Optional boolean; bare flag means `true`. |

### Board, version and output

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--board, -b <BOARD>` | Target board type. Inferred from the connected device if omitted. |
| `--version <VERSION>` | Firmware version to build against. Defaults to the latest release. Conflicts with `--firmware`, `--base-firmware`. |
| `--output, -o <FILE>` (alias `--out`) | Also write the built firmware to this file while flashing. |

### Reboot and flashing behaviour

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--stopped, -p` | After flashing, reboot into stopped (bootloader) mode. Conflicts with `--running`. |
| `--running, -r` | After flashing, reboot into running mode (the default). Conflicts with `--stopped`. |
| `--no-reboot` | Do not reboot after flashing. Conflicts with `--stopped`. |
| `--fast` | Skip the re-enumeration pause after the final reboot. Conflicts with `--no-reboot`. |
| `--msd, -m` | Mount mass storage when rebooting into stopped mode. |
| `--verify` | Verify flash by reading back after programming. **(not yet supported)** |
| `--force, -f` | Continue despite non-fatal problems: assembled firmware parse errors, a board type mismatch, and config warnings such as turbo boot with more than one non-plugin ROM slot. Each is reported as a warning instead. |
| `--batch` (aliases `--multiple`, `--multi`) | Program multiple devices, pausing for confirmation between each. Every board is programmed with the same configuration as the first. |
| `--scan-slots` | After programming, run `onerom scan --slots` to show the result. Conflicts with `--fast`. |

Device required: yes.

---

## inspect

Read-only inspection of a connected One ROM.

```
onerom inspect <COMMAND>
```

| Subcommand | Purpose | Device required |
|---|---|---|
| [`info`](#inspect-info) | Identity and configuration | Yes |
| [`telemetry`](#inspect-telemetry) | Runtime telemetry **(not yet supported)** | Yes |
| [`slots`](#inspect-slots) | List ROM slots | Yes |
| [`image`](#inspect-image) | Read a slot's ROM image **(not yet supported)** | Yes |
| [`peek`](#inspect-peek) | Read SRAM or the live ROM image | Yes |
| [`gpio`](#inspect-gpio) | Show what each GPIO is and what it is doing | Yes (running) |
| [`header`](#inspect-header) | Draw the device board's pin header | Yes |
| [`socket`](#inspect-socket) | Draw the device board's ROM socket pinout | Yes |

### inspect info

Show the device's serial number, user-assigned name, board type, MCU, firmware
version and hardware revision. With `--verbose` (`-v`), also shows the MCU
variant and chip ID.

```
onerom inspect info
onerom --serial 1234abcd inspect info
```

### inspect telemetry

Access counts, timing statistics and other runtime metrics. **(not yet
supported)**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Output telemetry as JSON. |

### inspect slots

List the ROM image slots stored on the device — index, ROM type, size and
description — marking the active slot. No options.

### inspect image

Read (or save) the ROM image from a slot. **(not yet supported)**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--slot <INDEX>` | Slot index to read. Reads the active slot if omitted. |
| `--output, -o <FILE>` (alias `--out`) | Save the image data to this file. |

### inspect peek

Read device memory. `peek memory` reads SRAM (and, in stopped state,
page-aligned flash); `peek live` reads the ROM image currently being served.

```
onerom inspect peek <COMMAND>
```

#### inspect peek live

Read from the live ROM image at a **logical** ROM offset (starting at 0). The
device must be running. Also reachable as the top-level [`peek`](#peek-top-level-alias).

```
onerom inspect peek live --address 0x100 --length 64
onerom inspect peek live --address 0 --length 8192 --output rom-image.bin
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--address, -a <ADDRESS>` (alias `--addr`) | Logical ROM address to read from, starting at 0. Decimal or `0x` hex. Default `0`. |
| `--length, -l <LENGTH>` (aliases `--len`, `--size`) | Number of bytes to read. Decimal or hex. If omitted, reads to the end of the live image. |
| `--output, -o <FILE>` (alias `--out`) | Save the data to this file. |

#### inspect peek memory

Read One ROM's SRAM. Most addresses reachable via PICOBOOT can be queried. In
stopped state, SRAM holds no meaningful data, and flash reads must be aligned to
flash page boundaries.

```
onerom inspect peek memory --address 0x20000000 --length 128
onerom inspect peek memory --address 0x10000000 --length 8192 --output flash-start.bin
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--address, -a <ADDRESS>` (alias `--addr`) | Address to read from. Decimal or `0x` hex. |
| `--length, -l <LENGTH>` (aliases `--len`, `--size`) | Number of bytes to read. Decimal or hex. |
| `--output, -o <FILE>` (alias `--out`) | Save the data to this file. |

### inspect gpio

Show, one row per MCU GPIO, what that GPIO is on this board and what One ROM is
currently doing with it.

The device must be **running** with the USB system plugin: One ROM's own
command handler lives in that plugin, and a stopped device is in the RP2350
bootloader where it does not exist. See [Device states](#device-states).

```
onerom inspect gpio
onerom inspect gpio --all
onerom inspect gpio --pin gpio9
onerom inspect gpio --pin x1
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--pin <PIN>` | Show only this pin, named as `gpio<N>` or as a header pad (see [Pin values](#pin-values)). Conflicts with `--all`. |
| `--board <BOARD>` | Board type, overriding what the device reports. Only needed to resolve a `--pin` pad name on a board this build does not recognise. |
| `--all` | Also list GPIOs with no function at all. By default only GPIOs connected to something are shown. |

By default the table lists only the GPIOs connected to **something** — a ROM
socket signal, a board peripheral or a header pad. On a 48-GPIO board a quarter
of the GPIOs are connected to nothing, and listing them buries the rows worth
reading; a line beneath the table says how many were omitted. `--all` lists
every GPIO. Note the filter is on what the GPIO *is*, not on what the device
reports using it for: the `X1`/`X2` and image-select pads report `free` and are
exactly what you read this table to find, so they always appear.

The number of GPIOs the device has is its own — 30 on an RP2350A, 48 on an
RP2350B.

Columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `GPIO` | MCU GPIO number. |
| `Function` | Everything this GPIO is, comma-separated in a fixed order: its ROM socket signal under the image being served (`A5`, `D3`, `CS1`, `BYTE/VPP`), then the board peripheral (`Status LED`, `RGB LED`, `USB VBUS`, `ext flash CS`), then the header pad (`X1`, `X2`, `SEL_A`). `-` if the GPIO is connected to nothing. |
| `Dir` | `out` if the pin's output driver is enabled, `in` if not. |
| `Level` | The level currently on the pad, `0` or `1`. |
| `Max V` | `5V` if the GPIO is 5V-tolerant, `3V3` if it is an RP2350 ADC pin and therefore 3.3V-only, `?` if the board is not characterised. |
| `One ROM use` | What One ROM itself is using the GPIO for: `free`, `serving (read)`, `serving (driven)` or `system`. |

`Function` lists everything that applies rather than stopping at the first
match, so a GPIO that is genuinely two things says so: on a `fire-24-f` the
Status LED and the RGB LED are the same GPIO, and it reads `Status LED,
RGB LED`. Names that would repeat are shown once — on a 32-pin board a high
address line is both the socket's `A17` and the `A17` header pad, which is one
net.

`Function` names only what a **GPIO** is. A header pad may carry more than the
GPIO behind it — on a Fire 24/28 board the `SEL_C` and `SEL_D` pads sit on the
SWCLK and SWDIO nets — but SWCLK and SWDIO are dedicated RP2350 pins with no
GPIO of their own, so they do not appear here. Run
[`inspect header`](#inspect-header) for the pad-by-pad view, which shows every
role each pad carries.

Only `Dir`, `Level` and `One ROM use` come from the device. `Function` is
derived by the CLI from the board's pin map and the chip type being served: the
device deliberately reports what taking a pin over would *cost*, never what the
pin *is*. `serving (read)` pins (address, chip-select, `/BYTE`) can be driven and
released; `serving (driven)` pins (the data pins) cannot be given back without a
reboot — see [`control pin`](#control-pin).

With `--verbose` (`-v`) the table is followed by a legend restating where each
column comes from, what `Dir` means and what the `3V3`/`5V` tags mean. Nothing
is lost without it: the cost of taking a serving pin over is stated at the point
of action by `control pin` itself.

A board revision or ROM type this build does not recognise costs the derived
names, not the listing: `Function` falls back to `-` (or, for a socket pin whose
chip type is unknown, `socket pin <N>`), and with no recognised board at all
nothing is filtered out, since nothing can be ruled out. On a board with no
pin-header descriptor, pad names come from the board's pin assignments alone and
`--verbose` says so beneath the table.

### inspect header

Draw the connected device's pin (jumper / programming) header as ASCII. The
board is inferred from the device. This is the device-oriented form of
[`board header`](#board-header); see there for what the diagram shows.

```
onerom inspect header [--board <board>]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--board`, `-b` | Board type, overriding what the connected One ROM reports. Only needed on a One ROM whose board type this build does not recognise. |

`--board` is an override, not a substitute for the device: this command draws
the board of a *connected* One ROM, so one must still be present. To draw a
board by name with nothing connected, use
[`board header`](#board-header).

### inspect socket

Draw the connected device's ROM socket pinout as ASCII. The board is inferred
from the device. This is the device-oriented form of
[`board socket`](#board-socket).

```
onerom inspect socket [--board <board>] [--chip-type <chip>] [--gpio]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--board`, `-b` | Board type, overriding what the connected One ROM reports. |
| `--chip-type <chip>`, `-c` | Label pins with this ROM type's functions instead of GPIOs, and report the chip's image size on this board. |
| `--gpio` | Overlay the GPIO(s) onto the `--chip-type` function view (requires `--chip-type`). |

As with [`inspect header`](#inspect-header), `--board` overrides the connected
One ROM's reported board type rather than standing in for the device.

---

## control

Transient actions on a connected One ROM. These affect current state but do not
persist across power cycles.

```
onerom control <COMMAND>
```

| Subcommand | Purpose | Device required |
|---|---|---|
| [`reboot`](#control-reboot) | Reboot the device | Yes |
| [`led`](#control-led) | Control the status LED | Yes |
| [`poke`](#control-poke) | Write to SRAM or the live ROM image | Yes |
| [`reset`](#control-reset) | Pulse a GPIO low to reset the host system | Yes (running) |
| [`select`](#control-select) | Select the active ROM slot **(not yet supported)** | Yes |
| [`pin`](#control-pin) | Drive a pin high, low or high-impedance | Yes (running) |
| [`erase`](#control-erase) | Erase flash memory | Yes |

### control reboot

Restart the firmware; the device re-initialises and resumes serving. By default
pauses afterwards for re-enumeration. Also reachable as the top-level
[`reboot`](#reboot-top-level-alias).

```
onerom control reboot
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--stopped, -p` | Reboot into stopped (bootloader) state. |
| `--running, -r` | Reboot into running (serving) state. Default. |
| `--fast` | Don't pause for re-enumeration. |
| `--msd, -m` | Mount mass storage when rebooting into stopped mode. Conflicts with `--running`. |

`--stopped` and `--running` are mutually exclusive.

### control led

```
onerom control led on
onerom control led off
```

| Subcommand | Description |
|---|---|
| `on` | Turn the status LED on. |
| `off` | Turn the status LED off. |
| `beacon` | Beacon the LED to identify a physical unit. |
| `flame` | Flame effect on the LED. |

None take options. Device required: yes.

### control poke

Transient writes to device memory — changes are lost on reboot. Use
[`update`](#update) for persistent flash writes.

```
onerom control poke <COMMAND>
```

#### control poke memory

Write a single byte or a binary file to SRAM at a given address. When the device
is running, virtual addresses are available (e.g. `0x90000000` is the start of
the live ROM image — though prefer `poke live` for that). Writing arbitrary SRAM
can corrupt firmware state.

```
onerom control poke memory --address 0x20000010 --byte 0xFF
onerom control poke memory --address 0x20000000 --input patch.bin
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--address, -a <ADDRESS>` (alias `--addr`) | Address to write to. Decimal or `0x` hex. |
| `--byte <BYTE>` (alias `--value`) | Single byte value to write. Decimal or hex. |
| `--input, -i <FILE>` (alias `--in`) | Write the contents of this binary file. |

Exactly one of `--byte` / `--input` is required.

#### control poke live

Write a single byte or a binary file to the live ROM image at a **logical** ROM
offset (starting at 0). Useful for patching a running ROM without reflashing.
Also reachable as the top-level [`poke`](#poke-top-level-alias).

```
onerom control poke live --address 0x100 --byte 0xEA
onerom control poke live --address 0 --input patch.bin
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--address, -a <ADDRESS>` (alias `--addr`) | Logical ROM address, starting at 0. Decimal or `0x` hex. Default `0`. |
| `--byte <BYTE>` (alias `--value`) | Single byte value to write. Decimal or hex. |
| `--input, -i <FILE>` (alias `--in`) | Write the contents of this binary file. |
| `--delta` (alias `--deltas`) | Only write bytes that differ from current device content. Requires `--input`. |
| `--dry-run` (alias `--dryrun`) | Show what would be written without writing. Requires `--delta`. |

Exactly one of `--byte` / `--input` is required.

### control reset

Pulse a GPIO low, then release it, to reset the host system One ROM is installed
in — useful in scripted workflows after programming a new image.

`--pin` is the pin your reset wire is soldered to, typically an image-select pad
whose jumper has been removed — `sel_c` is the usual choice, as more boards have
it than have X pads and it is 5V tolerant where it exists — or an `X1`/`X2` pad.
Name it by pad (`sel_c`, `x1`) or by MCU GPIO (`gpio9`) — see
[Pin values](#pin-values). [`inspect header`](#inspect-header) shows which GPIO
is behind each pad.

The line is only ever **driven low and then released to high impedance**. A reset
net has its own pull-up and may have other drivers on it, so there is
deliberately no way to drive it high. Use [`control pin`](#control-pin) if you
need arbitrary states.

The **device** times the pulse, not the CLI: if this command is interrupted, the
terminal closes or the cable is pulled mid-pulse, the device still releases the
pin. The device's own limit is 60 seconds.

The device must be **running** with the USB system plugin — see
[Device states](#device-states).

```
onerom control reset --pin sel_c
onerom control reset --pin gpio9
onerom control reset --pin gpio9 --hold 500
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--pin <PIN>` | Pin the reset wire is connected to, named as `gpio<N>` or as a header pad (see [Pin values](#pin-values)). Required. |
| `--board <BOARD>` | Board type, overriding what the device reports. Only needed to resolve a `--pin` pad name on a board this build does not recognise. |
| `--hold <MS>` | Milliseconds to hold reset asserted. Decimal or `0x` hex. Default `100`; `0` is rejected, because a reset pulse with no end is not a reset. |

If One ROM is itself using the GPIO the command is refused, naming what it is
doing; `control reset` has no `--force` of its own, and the message points at
`control pin --force` for the case where that is genuinely what you want. If the
GPIO is not 5V-tolerant the command warns and asks for confirmation, which
`--yes` answers.

```
$ onerom control reset --pin x1
Asserted reset on x1 (gpio9) for 100ms - the device times the pulse and releases the pin
```

### control select

Switch the device to serving the specified slot immediately (not persistent).
**(not yet supported)**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--slot <INDEX>` | Slot index to activate. Required. |

### control pin

Drive a One ROM pin high, low or high-impedance, optionally for a bounded
period.

`--pin` names an MCU GPIO or a header pad (see [Pin values](#pin-values)); the
command is named for what is being addressed rather than for any one spelling.

Without `--hold` the state is latched until something else changes it. With
`--hold` the **device** holds the state for that many milliseconds and then
applies `--then` — high impedance unless you say otherwise. As with
[`control reset`](#control-reset), the hold is timed on the device, so an
interrupted CLI cannot leave a pin latched.

The device must be **running** with the USB system plugin — see
[Device states](#device-states). [`inspect gpio`](#inspect-gpio) shows what each
GPIO is and what One ROM is using it for.

```
onerom control pin --pin gpio9 --state high
onerom control pin --pin gpio9 --state low --hold 250
onerom control pin --pin gpio9 --state low --hold 250 --then high
onerom control pin --pin x1 --state 0 --hold 250
onerom control pin --pin sel_a --state z
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--pin <PIN>` | Pin to drive, named as `gpio<N>` or as a header pad (see [Pin values](#pin-values)). Required. |
| `--board <BOARD>` | Board type, overriding what the device reports. Only needed to resolve a `--pin` pad name on a board this build does not recognise. |
| `--state <STATE>` | `high`, `low`, or `z` (high-impedance). `1` and `0` are accepted for `high` and `low`. Required. |
| `--hold <MS>` | Hold `--state` for this many milliseconds, then apply `--then`. Decimal or `0x` hex. Omit to latch indefinitely. The device's own limit is 60 seconds. |
| `--then <STATE>` | State to apply when `--hold` expires: `high`, `low` or `z` (or `1`/`0`). Default `z`. Requires `--hold`. |
| `--force` | Drive the GPIO even though One ROM is using it for serving. |

**Refusals and warnings.** If One ROM is itself using the GPIO, the command is
refused and names what it is doing. `--force` overrides, and prints what that
costs:

- a pin serving **reads** (address, chip-select, `/BYTE`) is reversible — serving
  keeps reading it, and `--state z` puts it back;
- a pin serving **drives** (a data pin) is not — forcing it takes the pin away
  from the PIO that drives it, and serving stays broken until the device is
  rebooted.

If the GPIO is not 5V-tolerant — an RP2350 ADC pin, per the board metadata, not
a measurement — the command warns and asks for confirmation, which `--yes` or
`--force` answers. Nothing else about the pad is checked: what is wired to it,
whether a jumper is fitted and what voltage the far end sits at are yours to
know.

```
$ onerom control pin --pin x1 --state low --hold 2000
Set x1 (gpio9) low for 2000ms - the device times the hold and then sets it high impedance
```

### control erase

Permanently erase flash contents — firmware, metadata and ROM images. A fully
erased unit boots into the RP2350 bootloader and is reprogrammed with
`--unrecognised` + `--board`.

Best performed while stopped; by default the command reboots into the required
state first. Erasing the core firmware or the system plugin while **running**
takes down the USB stack (requiring manual BOOTSEL via the header pins), and
large erases may cause a temporary USB drop and re-enumerate — in which case the
erase likely succeeded and can be checked with `inspect peek memory`. Anything
else running from flash (e.g. a user plugin) may crash during an erase.

Offsets are relative to the flash base `0x10000000`. Ranges must be 4096-aligned.
Multiple ranges may be erased in one operation.

```
onerom control erase --all
onerom control erase --offset 0x20000 --length 0x1000
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--all, -a` | Erase all flash contents. |
| `--offset <OFFSET>` | Erase at offset(s) from the flash base. 4096-aligned; pair each with a `--length`; repeatable. Conflicts with `--address`. |
| `--address <ADDRESS>` (alias `--addr`) | Erase at absolute address(es). 4096-aligned; pair each with a `--length`; repeatable. Conflicts with `--offset`. |
| `--length <LENGTH>` (aliases `--len`, `--size`) | Length of each range. 4096-aligned; specify once per `--offset`/`--address`; repeatable. Conflicts with `--all`. |
| `--no-reboot, -n` | Don't reboot before or after erasing. Risky if One ROM is accessing the range. |
| `--stopped, -p` | Reboot into stopped mode after erasing. |
| `--running, -r` | Reboot into running mode after erasing. |
| `--msd, -m` | Mount mass storage when rebooting into stopped mode. Requires `--stopped`. |
| `--fast` | Don't pause for re-enumeration. Requires a reboot mode. |

One of `--all` / `--offset` / `--address` is required. `--stopped` and
`--running` are mutually exclusive, and both conflict with `--no-reboot`.

---

## update

Persistent modifications — these write to flash and survive power cycles.

```
onerom update <COMMAND>
```

| Subcommand | Purpose | Device required |
|---|---|---|
| [`slot`](#update-slot) | Write a ROM image to a flash slot **(not yet supported)** | Yes |
| [`commit`](#update-commit) | Commit the live image to flash **(not yet supported)** | Yes |
| [`otp`](#update-otp) | Read/write OTP memory **(not yet supported, hidden)** | Yes |

### update slot

Write a ROM image to a flash slot; persists across power cycles. The ROM type
and chip-select configuration must match the slot's existing configuration, or
the slot must be empty. **(not yet supported)**

```
onerom update slot --slot 2 --image kernal.bin
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--slot <INDEX>` | Flash slot index to write. Required. |
| `--image <FILE>` | ROM image file to write. Required. |

### update commit

Persist the currently active RAM image to its corresponding flash slot. **(not
yet supported)**

```
onerom update commit
onerom update commit --slot 2
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--slot <INDEX>` | Slot to commit. Commits the active slot if omitted. |

### update otp

Read or write RP2350 OTP memory, including One ROM-specific USB configuration and
identity data. Hidden, advanced. **OTP writes are irreversible.** **(not yet
supported)**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--read` | Read and display OTP contents. Conflicts with `--write`. |
| `--write <ROW=VALUE>` | Write a value to an OTP row. Conflicts with `--read`. |

---

## image

ROM image file manipulation. No device connection required.

```
onerom image <COMMAND>
```

### image swap-bytes

Swap adjacent byte pairs — reverses byte order within each 16-bit word
throughout the image. Required for 16-bit ROM types (e.g. 27C400) when the source
has the opposite byte order to what One ROM expects. The input must have an even
number of bytes.

```
onerom image swap-bytes --input kick.bin --output kick-swapped.bin
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--input, -i <FILE>` (alias `--in`) | Input ROM image file. |
| `--output, -o <FILE>` (alias `--out`) | Output file path. |

The same operation is available during a build as
`--slot transform=swap_bytes`; see [Image transforms](#image-transforms).

Device required: no.

### image deinterleave

Extract one lane from an interleaved ROM image. The image contains `--stride`
interleaved lanes of `--bytes` bytes each; lane `--offset` is kept and the rest
discarded. Used to split a wide ROM image, distributed as a single interleaved
file, into the narrower images each device needs.

The input length must be a multiple of `--bytes × --stride`; the output is
`1/--stride` of the input length.

```
# odd bytes of a 16-bit interleaved image
onerom image deinterleave --input rom16.bin --output odd.bin --offset 1 --stride 2

# byte 2 of a 32-bit interleaved image
onerom image deinterleave --input rom32.bin --output b2.bin --offset 2 --stride 4

# the upper 16-bit half of each 32-bit word
onerom image deinterleave --input rom32.bin --output hi.bin --offset 1 --stride 2 --bytes 2
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--input, -i <FILE>` (alias `--in`) | Input ROM image file. |
| `--output, -o <FILE>` (alias `--out`) | Output file path. |
| `--offset <N>` | Which lane to keep. Must be less than `--stride`. |
| `--stride <N>` | How many lanes the image interleaves. Must be at least 2. |
| `--bytes <N>` (alias `--unit`) | Width of one lane, in bytes. Defaults to `1`; use `2` to keep 16-bit words together. |

The same operation is available during a build as
`--slot transform=deinterleave:<offset>/<stride>[/<bytes>]`; see
[Image transforms](#image-transforms).

Device required: no.

### image convert

Convert a ROM image between formats. Reads `--input` in the `--from` format and
writes `--output` in the `--to` format. Formats: `binary` (aliases `bin`, `raw`)
and `ihex` (Intel HEX; aliases `intel-hex`, `intel_hex`). The format set is
designed to grow — further formats can be added without changing the command.

```
onerom image convert --from ihex --to binary --input rom.hex --output rom.bin
onerom image convert --from binary --to ihex --input rom.bin --output rom.hex --load-address $E000
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--from <FORMAT>` | Input format: `binary` or `ihex`. |
| `--to <FORMAT>` | Output format: `binary` or `ihex`. |
| `--input, -i <FILE>` (alias `--in`) | Input ROM image file. |
| `--output, -o <FILE>` (alias `--out`) | Output file path. |
| `--load-address <ADDR>` | Intel HEX load address (decimal, or `0x`/`$`-prefixed hex). Only valid when one side is `ihex`; subtracted when reading ihex, used as the base when writing ihex. Defaults to `0`. |

Intel HEX output uses 16-byte records with a terminating EOF record; unwritten
addresses read as `0xFF` when decoding. Device required: no.

---

## firmware

Build, inspect and manage firmware binaries. Use [`program`](#program) to flash;
`firmware build` produces a binary without flashing.

```
onerom firmware <COMMAND>
```

| Subcommand | Purpose | Device required |
|---|---|---|
| [`build`](#firmware-build) | Build a firmware binary from a config | No |
| [`inspect`](#firmware-inspect) | Inspect a firmware binary | No |
| [`releases`](#firmware-releases) | List firmware releases | No |
| [`download`](#firmware-download) | Download a release binary | No |
| [`chips`](#firmware-chips) | List supported chip types and their flash usage | No |
| `program` | Alias for [`onerom program`](#program) | Yes |

### firmware build

Produce a flashable firmware binary for a board and MCU from a JSON config or
inline `--slot` args, without flashing.

```
onerom firmware build --config c64.json --board fire-24-e --out firmware.bin
onerom firmware build --board fire-24-e \
    --slot file=kernal.bin,type=2364,cs1=active-low \
    --out firmware.bin
```

The configuration options mirror [`program`](#program): `--config` (`-j`),
`--slot`, `--plugin`, `--config-name`, `--config-description`, `--save-config`,
`--no-config`, and the per-device overrides `--instance-name`,
`--serial-override`, `--logging`, `--disable-swd`, `--turbo-boot` (all rejected
with `--no-config`). Build-specific options:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--board, -b <BOARD>` | Target board type. Required when not inferrable from a connected device. |
| `--version <VERSION>` | Firmware version to build against. Defaults to latest. |
| `--base-firmware <FILE>` | Use a local minimal firmware instead of downloading. Must be built with `EXCLUDE_METADATA=1` and `ROM_CONFIGS=`. Conflicts with `--version`. |
| `--output, -o <FILE>` (alias `--out`) | Output file path. Defaults to `onerom-<board>-<version>.bin`. Conflicts with `--path`. |
| `--path <DIR>` | Output directory, using the default filename. Conflicts with `--output`. |
| `--force, -f` | Continue despite non-fatal problems: assembled firmware parse errors, a board type mismatch, and config warnings such as turbo boot with more than one non-plugin ROM slot. Each is reported as a warning instead. |

Device required: no.

### firmware inspect

Show a firmware binary's version, board type, MCU, and embedded ROM images and
metadata.

```
onerom firmware inspect --firmware firmware.bin
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--firmware <FILE>` (aliases `--fw`, `--in`, `--input`) | Firmware binary to inspect. |
| `--board, -b <BOARD>` | Inspect the release firmware for this board type. Conflicts with `--firmware`. |
| `--version <VERSION>` | Firmware version to inspect. Defaults to latest. Conflicts with `--firmware`. |

### firmware releases

List available firmware releases with supported boards and MCUs.

```
onerom firmware releases
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--board, -b <BOARD>` | Show only releases for this board type. |
| `--all, -a` | Show all releases even if a device is attached and detected. Conflicts with `--board`. |

### firmware download

Download the base (ROM-less) firmware binary for a version/board/MCU.

```
onerom firmware download --version 0.6.5 --board fire-24-e --out firmware.bin
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--version <VERSION>` | Version to download. Defaults to latest. |
| `--board, -b <BOARD>` | Target board type. Inferred from device if omitted. |
| `--output, -o <FILE>` (alias `--out`) | Output file path. Defaults to `onerom_<board>_<version>.bin`. Conflicts with `--path`. |
| `--path <DIR>` | Output directory, using the default filename. Conflicts with `--output`. |

This firmware binary can then be used as a base for [`firmware build`](#firmware-build) or flashed with
[`program`](#program) using the `--base-firmware` option.  Do not flash it directly, as it contains no ROM configuration and will not serve any ROMs.

### firmware chips

List the chip types a board can emulate and the flash each one uses, or all chip
types grouped by pin count. Identical to the top-level [`chips`](#chips).

```
onerom firmware chips --board fire-24-e
onerom firmware chips --board fire-24-e --chip-type 2364
onerom firmware chips --all
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--board, -b <BOARD>` | Show supported chips for this board. Conflicts with `--all`. |
| `--all, -a` | Show all chips grouped by pin count. Conflicts with `--board`. |
| `--chip-type, -c <CHIP>` | Show just this chip type's flash usage on the board. Conflicts with `--all`. |

---

## plugin

List available plugins from the release manifest, with versions and minimum
firmware requirements. Without a connected device or `--fw-version`, minimum
firmware requirements are shown for reference; with either, incompatible plugins
are flagged.

```
onerom plugin
onerom plugin --all-versions
onerom plugin --type system
onerom plugin --fw-version 0.6.6
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--all-versions, -a` | Show all versions of each plugin, not just the latest. |
| `--type, -t <TYPE>` | Filter by plugin type: `system` or `user`. |
| `--fw-version <VERSION>` | Firmware version to check compatibility against. |

Device required: no.

---

## chips

List supported chip types — for a board, with the flash each one uses, or all
grouped by pin count. Top-level alias for [`firmware chips`](#firmware-chips).

```
onerom chips --board fire-24-e
onerom chips --board fire-24-e --chip-type 2364
onerom chips --all
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--board, -b <BOARD>` | Show supported chips for this board. Conflicts with `--all`. |
| `--all, -a` | Show all chips grouped by pin count. Conflicts with `--board`. |
| `--chip-type, -c <CHIP>` | Show just this chip type's flash usage on the board. Conflicts with `--all`. |

### Flash usage

For a board, each chip is listed with its **ROM size** (the chip's own capacity)
and its **image size** — the flash One ROM uses to emulate it, which is often
larger, and occasionally much larger. The figures, and the grouping, are the same
ones published in [Chip Compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md); the document is
generated from the same source the CLI reads, so the two agree.

Chips are grouped by how they fit the board's socket, and the **Fit** column
names the fit exactly:

| Fit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `native` | Chip and board have the same pin count — it goes straight in. |
| `overhang` | Chip has *fewer* pins than the board, so One ROM's top pins hang out of the socket. |
| `larger socket (no fly-leads)` | Chip has *more* pins than the board, but no address line among the extra ones: One ROM sits bottom-justified in the socket, with nothing to wire. |
| `fly-lead to X1` / `fly-lead to X1 and X2` | Chip has more pins than the board, and the overhanging address line(s) must be wired to One ROM's `X1` (and `X2`) header pin. |

Every fit other than `native` is a cross-size fit, and in all of them One ROM's
power pins may not line up with the socket's — **power must be rerouted to One
ROM's own VCC/5V pin**. `larger socket (no fly-leads)` means no *signal* wiring
is needed; it does not mean the chip simply drops in. Use
[`board socket`](#board-socket) with `--chip-type` and `--gpio` to see exactly
where One ROM's VCC lands.

The sizes are for a chip served alone in its slot. A banked or multi-ROM set
draws further lines into the slot's address window, so its image can be larger
than the figure shown here; build the firmware and run
[`onerom firmware inspect`](#firmware-inspect) to see what a specific set costs.

Chips are listed only where a size can be derived, which means Fire (RP2350)
boards. An Ice (STM32) board falls back to a plain list of names. A chip type of
the board's own pin count that the board cannot serve — either because no
firmware serves it yet (the SRAM types, at the time of writing) or because this
particular board's layout cannot place it — is named in a trailing line rather
than tabulated.

Board is taken from `--board`, or inferred from a connected One ROM. `--chip-type`
accepts any chip type the board can emulate, under any accepted spelling.

Example output (illustrative — your build may differ):

```
$ onerom chips --board fire-24-f
Supported chip types for fire-24-f (One ROM Fire 24 (rev F)):

  24-pin chips (native)
    Chip       ROM size  Image size  Fit
    2704           512B        512B  native

    2764            8KB        32KB  fly-lead to X1

  Image size is the flash One ROM uses to emulate the chip, which may exceed the chip's own ROM size.  See docs/COMPATIBILITY.md.

  Recognised but not servable on this board: 2016, 6116

Supported plugin types:
  SystemPlugin, UserPlugin
```

A single chip type, on the board that makes the point — an 8KB ROM costing 256KB
of flash, because One ROM overhangs a 28-pin socket to emulate a 24-pin part:

```
$ onerom chips --board fire-28-c --chip-type 2364
2364 on fire-28-c (One ROM Fire 28 (rev C)):
  ROM size    8KB
  Image size  256KB
  Fit         overhang
```

With `--all`, chip types are listed by pin count without sizes, which are
board-dependent:

```
Supported 24-pin chips:
  2016, 2316, 2332, 2364, 2704, 2708, 2716, 2732, 27C32, 28C16, 4732, 4764, ...
Supported 28-pin chips:
  231024, 23128, 23256, 23512, 23C1000, 23QL384, 23QL512, 27128, 27256, ...
Supported 32-pin chips:
  23C1001, 23C1010, 27C010, 27C020, 27C040, 29F010, 39SF010, SST39SF040, ...

```

Device required: no (a device is used only to infer the board when `--board` is
omitted).

## board

List supported One ROM board types, or draw a board's physical pin layouts as
ASCII.

```
onerom board <COMMAND>
```

| Subcommand | Purpose | Device required |
|---|---|---|
| [`list`](#board-list) | List the supported board types | No |
| [`header`](#board-header) | Draw a board's pin (jumper) header | No |
| [`socket`](#board-socket) | Draw a board's ROM socket pinout | No |

### board list

Lists the board types, in two groups. This replaces the bare `onerom boards` of
earlier releases, which no longer exists.

The first group is the boards the CLI can act on — the Fire (RP2350) boards.
The second is the Ice (STM32) boards, which the CLI recognises but cannot scan,
program or build firmware for; naming one on a command that needs a device or an
image is an error. Commands that only report hardware still take them.

```
onerom board list
```

Example output (illustrative — your build may differ):

```
Supported One ROM board types:
  fire-24-a, fire-24-c, fire-24-d, fire-24-e, fire-24-eadb01, fire-24-f, fire-24-usb-b, fire-28-a, fire-28-b, fire-28-c, fire-28-d, fire-32-a, fire-32-b, fire-40-a, fire-40-b

Recognised, but not supported by the CLI:
  ice-24-d, ice-24-e, ice-24-f, ice-24-g, ice-24-i, ice-24-j, ice-24-usb-h, ice-28-a
  These boards use an STM32, rather than the RP2350 the CLI works with.
```

`onerom scan --list-boards` prints the same listing.

Device required: no.

### board header

Draw a board's pin (jumper / programming) header — the 2xN header along the
board's top edge — as ASCII, pad by pad. Each image-select and X pad is
annotated with the MCU GPIO behind it, and on RP2350 (Fire) boards with whether
that GPIO is 5V-tolerant (`5V`) or 3.3V-only (`!!3V3!!` — an ADC pin that must
not be driven above 3.3V). See [Voltage Levels](VOLTAGE-LEVELS.md) for the ADC
caveat.

```
onerom board header [--board <board>]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--board`, `-b` | Board type to draw (e.g. `fire-24-f`). Inferred from a connected One ROM if omitted. |

A board with no pin-header descriptor prints a short notice instead of a
diagram.

```
onerom board header --board fire-24-f
```

Device required: no (a device is used only to infer `--board` when it is
omitted).

### board socket

Draw a board's ROM socket pinout as a DIP diagram.

```
onerom board socket [--board <board>] [--chip-type <chip>] [--gpio]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--board`, `-b` | Board type to draw (e.g. `fire-24-f`). Inferred from a connected One ROM if omitted. |
| `--chip-type`, `-c` | Label pins with this chip type's ROM functions instead of GPIOs. |
| `--gpio` | Overlay the GPIO(s) behind each pin onto the `--chip-type` view. Requires `--chip-type`. |

Without `--chip-type`, each socket pin is labelled with the GPIO(s) behind it (the
GPIO map). With `--chip-type <chip>` (e.g. `2364`), the pins are labelled with that
ROM's functions (address / data / chip-select / `BYTE` / power / …) instead;
add `--gpio` to overlay both. `--gpio` requires `--chip-type`. A pin that carries
two functions on a multiplexed part (e.g. the 27C400's pin 29, `A0/D15`) shows
both.

The two views that label pins with GPIOs — no `--chip-type`, or `--gpio` — need
the board's GPIO map. A board without one reports that and draws nothing; the
`--chip-type` function view still works, as it is drawn from the chip's pinout
and the board's ROM signal assignments.

When the chip's pin count differs from the board's, the socket is drawn at the
larger of the two and the smaller device is bottom-justified (see
[Chip Compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md)):

- emulating a **smaller** ROM on a larger One ROM, One ROM's extra pins hang out
  of the socket and are marked `overhang` (reroute power to One ROM's VCC/5V pin);
- emulating a **larger** ROM on a smaller One ROM, the socket pins One ROM does
  not reach are marked `(empty)`, and any address line there shows the One ROM
  `X1`/`X2` header pin it must be fly-leaded to (e.g. `A12 → X1`).

In both cases One ROM's own power pins may not line up with the ROM's. With
`--gpio`, the pin One ROM's VCC (or GND) lands on is annotated `(VCC)`/`(GND)` —
e.g. `NC (VCC)` shows One ROM's VCC sitting on the ROM's NC pin — so you know
where power must be applied.

With `--chip-type`, the diagram is followed by that chip's image size on this
board — the flash One ROM uses to emulate it, as reported by
[`onerom chips`](#chips).

`--chip-type` must be a chip type the board can emulate (native, overhang or
fly-lead; see [`onerom chips`](#chips) and
[Chip Compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md)).

```
onerom board socket --board fire-24-f
onerom board socket --board fire-24-f --chip-type 2364
onerom board socket --board fire-24-f --chip-type 2364 --gpio
```

Device required: no (a device is used only to infer `--board` when it is
omitted).

## Top-level aliases

Convenience aliases for frequently used nested commands. They take the same
options as their targets.

### peek (top-level alias)

Alias for [`inspect peek live`](#inspect-peek-live).

```
onerom peek live --address 0x100 --length 64
```

### poke (top-level alias)

Alias for [`control poke live`](#control-poke-live).

```
onerom poke live --address 0x100 --input patch.bin
```

### reboot (top-level alias)

Alias for [`control reboot`](#control-reboot).

```
onerom reboot
```

---

## ROM slot specification

Used by `--slot` in [`program`](#program) and [`firmware build`](#firmware-build).
Repeat `--slot` once per slot. Comma-separated `key=value` pairs:

```
file=<path_or_url>,type=<romtype>[,cs1=<logic>][,cs2=<logic>][,cs3=<logic>]
    [,size-handling=<handling>][,format=<binary|ihex>][,load-address=<addr>]
    [,transform=<list>]
    [,cpu-freq=<freq>][,cpu-vreg=<voltage>][,led=<bool>][,force-16-bit=<bool>]
```

| Key | Values / notes |
|---|---|
| `file` | Local path or URL to the ROM image. |
| `type` | Chip type, e.g. `2364`, `2332`, `2716`, `27C400`. Any type the target firmware can serve on the board is accepted — that is exactly what [`chips --board`](#chips) lists, including the overhang and fly-lead combinations (a `2764` on a Fire 24, say); see [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md). Building for firmware older than v0.7.0 accepts a narrower set, and a rejection lists what that firmware serves. Any accepted alias may be used; the exact spelling you enter is preserved in the device metadata (shown by `scan`/`inspect`), while the resolved type drives behaviour. |
| `cs1`, `cs2`, `cs3` | CS polarity: `active-low` (or `0`), `active-high` (or `1`), or `ignore`. The snake_case config spellings (`active_low`, `active_high`) are also accepted. Which lines are required depends on the chip type (e.g. `2332` requires `cs1` and `cs2`). `ignore` says One ROM does not monitor the line at all — it is not a polarity, and is only permitted where the chip type or set allows it (see `allow_cs_ignore`). |
| `size-handling` (aliases `size`, `size_handling`) | `none`, `duplicate` (or `dup`), `truncate` (or `trunc`), `pad`. For an Intel HEX image, padding fills with `0xFF` and `duplicate` is not permitted. |
| `format` | `binary` (default) or `ihex` (Intel HEX). An `ihex` file is decoded to a binary image before use; unwritten bytes read as `0xFF`. |
| `load-address` (alias `load_address`) | Only valid with `format=ihex`. The absolute Intel HEX address that maps to byte 0 of the ROM, as a decimal or `0x`/`$`-prefixed hex value (e.g. `$E000`). Defaults to `0`. |
| `transform` | Byte-level rearrangements of the image, applied in the order given and joined with `+`. See [Image transforms](#image-transforms). |
| `cpu-freq` | e.g. `150`, `150mhz`, `150MHz`. Values above 150 MHz require confirmation (suppressed by `--yes`) and set overclock automatically. |
| `cpu-vreg` | e.g. `1.1`, `1.10`, `1.10v`, `1.10V`. Values above 1.10 V require confirmation (suppressed by `--yes`). Must be a supported level. |
| `led` | Boolean: `on`/`off`, `true`/`false`, `1`/`0`. |
| `force-16-bit` (alias `force_16bit`) | Boolean (as above). Valid only on 40-pin boards. |

--slot file=rom32.bin,type=27C010,transform=deinterleave:1/2/2+swap_bytes
```

## Image transforms

Some ROM images are not laid out the way the target chip needs them: a 16-bit
part whose image was produced with the opposite byte order, or a wide image
that interleaves several narrower devices. Transforms rearrange the bytes
before the image is written into the firmware.

They are available two ways, and both run exactly the same operation:

- as the `transform=` key of a [`--slot`](#rom-slot-specification), or a
  `"transform"` array in a config file, applied during the build;
- as the standalone [`image swap-bytes`](#image-swap-bytes) and
  [`image deinterleave`](#image-deinterleave) subcommands, which rewrite a file.

| Transform | Effect |
|---|---|
| `swap_bytes` | Reverses the byte order within each 16-bit word. The image must have an even length. |
| `deinterleave:<offset>/<stride>` | The image contains `stride` interleaved lanes one byte wide; keep lane `offset`. |
| `deinterleave:<offset>/<stride>/<bytes>` | As above, with lanes `bytes` wide — use `2` to keep 16-bit words together. |

The parameters are positional, in the order `<offset>/<stride>/<bytes>`, and
`<bytes>` may be omitted (it defaults to `1`).

Each name has aliases, accepted identically by the CLI and by a config file:

| Canonical | Also accepted |
|---|---|
| `swap_bytes` | `swap-bytes`, `swapbytes` |
| `deinterleave` | `de_interleave`, `de-interleave`, `deint` |
| `transform=` (slot key) | `trans=` |

`deinterleave` requires the image length to be a multiple of `bytes × stride`
— one full set of lanes. The result is `1/stride` of the input length.

Transforms are applied **in the order listed**, and the order matters:

```
transform=deinterleave:1/2/2+swap_bytes
```

takes the upper 16-bit half of each 32-bit word and *then* swaps its byte
pairs. Note that `offset` selects which lane, not a named "high" or "low" half
— which half you get depends on the byte order of your source image, and that
is what `swap_bytes` is for.

Within the build pipeline, transforms run after any `location` window and after
an Intel HEX image has been decoded, but before `size-handling` reconciles the
image against the chip size. A `swap_bytes` on an odd-length image is an error
unless `size-handling` is `pad` (which appends one blank byte) or `truncate`
(which drops the trailing byte). Where the size handling is used this way it
counts as having been needed, so it is not then reported as redundant even if
the transformed image lands on exactly the chip size.

Common recipes:

| Goal | Spec |
|---|---|
| 16-bit image with the wrong byte order | `transform=swap_bytes` |
| Even / odd bytes of a 16-bit interleaved image | `transform=deinterleave:0/2` / `transform=deinterleave:1/2` |
| Byte *n* of a 32-bit interleaved image | `transform=deinterleave:<n>/4` |
| One 16-bit half of a 32-bit interleaved image | `transform=deinterleave:0/2/2` or `deinterleave:1/2/2` |

The transforms applied to an image are recorded in the firmware metadata
alongside its filename — as `kick.bin|transform=swap_bytes` — so a built image
carries a record of how its ROM data was derived. Note that the metadata
filename field is capped at 128 bytes, so the suffix can be truncated away for a
very long path; use `label=` to keep it short.

## Plugin specification

Used by `--plugin` in [`program`](#program) and [`firmware build`](#firmware-build).
At most one system plugin and one user plugin; a user plugin requires a system
plugin. The system plugin is placed in slot 0, the user plugin in slot 1.

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--plugin usb` | Latest compatible version, by name. |
| `--plugin system/usb` | With explicit type (`system` or `user`). |
| `--plugin usb,version=0.1.0` | Pinned version. |
| `--plugin file=path/to/plugin.bin` | Local file. |
| `--plugin file=https://example.com/plugin.bin` | Remote file. |
## Pin values

Used by `--pin` in [`control pin`](#control-pin), [`control
reset`](#control-reset) and [`inspect gpio`](#inspect-gpio).

`--pin` names one **MCU GPIO**, either directly or through a header pad that is
wired to one. All spellings are case-insensitive (`GPIO23`, `SEL_A`).

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `gpio<N>` | An MCU GPIO — for example `gpio23`. |
| `sel_a` … `sel_e` | An image-select pad. `sel-a` and `sela` are also accepted. |
| `x1`, `x2` | An X pad. |

A pad name resolves against the **board**, since which GPIO sits behind `sel_a`
is a fact about the board and not about the name. The board is normally read
from the connected device; `--board` overrides it, and is what you need if this
build does not recognise the device's board revision. `gpio<N>` needs no board.
A board that has no such pad — `sel_e` on a four-select board, `x1` on a board
with no X pads — is an error naming the pads that board does have.

Resolution uses the board's electrical pin assignments, not its header layout,
so pad names work on every board, including those whose physical header is not
yet characterised.

A bare number is **rejected**. `23` could be an MCU GPIO, an image-select pad, an
X pad or a ROM socket pin, and driving the wrong one is not a recoverable
mistake, so the CLI names the namespaces rather than guessing. Accepting pad
names does not remove that ambiguity — it sharpens it.

The broken-out address pads (`a<N>`) are recognised and **deliberately refused**,
now and in future. `--pin` addresses MCU GPIOs and the pads a wire can reach; an
address line is a ROM signal rather than one of those, and accepting `a17` would
invite `a11` or `d3`, which have no pad at all. Use the MCU GPIO behind the pad.
`run`, `bootsel`, `swclk` and `swdio` are reported as not being GPIOs that can be
driven. There is no syntax for a ROM socket leg.

Run [`onerom inspect header`](#inspect-header) to see which GPIO is behind each
header pad, or [`onerom inspect gpio`](#inspect-gpio) for the full per-GPIO
listing.

The upper bound is the device's own GPIO count — 30 on an RP2350A, 48 on an
RP2350B — read from the device rather than assumed, so a GPIO the device does not
have is reported against what it does have.
